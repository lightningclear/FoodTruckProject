# FoodTruckProject
Goal: to create an app that will allow the user to enter in their own set of values pertaining to Food Trucks near them and rate them individually.
Struggles:i think a large amount of the struggling i had within this project was figuring out how to create the project from scratch, i have the general idea of what to do in my head but i struggled immensely when i was trying to piece it all together in a manner that would be simple.
Lessons: i think actually spending time and drafting out what the program should do would be really efficient in sparing me the pain of trying to write a program from scratch, as well as finding credible resources that would allow me to write code in a manner that would haven't me scratching my head
Learning: during this project i learned that i don't need to make super complicated code ideas to get the job done, keeping it simple would benefit me in the long struggling
